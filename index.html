							<h1>Lonely Autonomous Sentry Turret (L.A.S.T.)</h1>
							<p>
								This was the final project for my first year progamming and hardware courses (joint project between MTE 100 and GENE 121). This was a group project done with 3 other people. The turret tracked moving targets and shot any target closer than a certain distance. The motion detection was done on a laptop, and the target position was sent to an Arduino. The Arduino controlled the servos, and the nerf gun.
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>Since this was a 2~3 week project, I mostly focused on the motion detection. I created a motion algorithm that was O(n), n being the pixels in the image.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The program was written in C++.</li>
								<li>The motion detection algorithm was optimized to be O(n+t); n as the number of pixels, t as the number of targets guaranteed to be less than n.</li>
								<li>The Nerf gun was over-volted, to increase range and firing speed.</li>

							<h1>Project Overlord</h1>
							<p>
								This was Aurora High School's robotics team entry for the Robofest exhibition games. The idea behind The Project was to build a unique, versatile, autonomous quadcopter. I was the Team Captain on the team - we ended up winning second place at the Robofest World championship 2012, in the respective division.
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>
								The unique feature was that the quadcopter was running on x86 hardware. We chose x86 since our priority was rapid development and tight deadlines. With x86, we got the full software stack with it - allowing us to use USB 2.0 as an on-board communication protocol, and WiFi for ground control. In addition, we had the option of running any PC-based programs (such as real-time data analysis, etc), and the relatively powerful CPU meant not worrying about using double-precision floats for internal calculations.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Designed, programmed and implemented a custom quadcopter design (software, control and mechanical). The software was a real-time multithreaded C++ application.</li>
								<li>Ported and integrated an open-source library for communications with an existing ground control station via TCP/IP over WiFi.</li>
								<li>Derived linearly independent control vectors, created multiple mechanical rigs for tuning those vectors.</li>
								<li>Soldered and assembled the components.</li>

							<h1>Motion Detection Suite</h1>
							<p>This program was created in collaboration with a classmate as a final project for my grade 12 Computer Science class. The program would read in a series of images, detect moving objects, and track targets between the frames. <a href="assets/img/image_m6.png">HERE</a> is a larger version of the thumbnail to the left - the target box and the motion path lines can be seen better. The images were taken from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEHQJn_hxo">THIS</a> video.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
							<p>The program reads in two images at a time: the current image and the background image. It compares the pixels of the current image to the background image, and if the difference is big enough, the pixel is labelled as a "motion pixel". Then, touching pixels are grouped into targets. The program searches for other targets in previous frames that are similar to the current target, and draws possible motion lines.</p>

								<li>The final project was coded in collaboration with Jack Mosely.</li>

								<li>Optimized algorithms for motion detection and noise reduction.</li>
